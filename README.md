# Journeys into Procedural Generation

This repo is a spin off from my terminal based rougelike game due to the amount of ideas i was getting for additional features that would be great to include but would slow down the completion of the core project. This repo will hopefully prevent scope creep killing the completion of the core project.

## Core Idea

I want to be able to build deep intertwined lore and history of a fantasy world generated entirely procedurally and the flow of history is influenced only by events that happen throughout the history fo the world

## Key steps

1. People and places
2. World, Region and Local generation
3. Items and their history
4. Events

## Language change

Originally i wanted to write this is python however i quickly realized that with the large number of processes i wasn't getting the performance i wanted. Re-writing this in C++ has given me a great excuse to learn C++ properly, up until now only written arduino C++, as well as improve the speed greatly even when not optimized due to not being proficient with the language.
